          This study suggested that methane emissions from the inventory were consistent with atmospheric data in recent
          years. However, in the 1990s and early 2000s, the two methods disagreed. This information is now allowing the
          inventory teams to examine assumptions in the earlier record, and, hopefully, improve our understand of the
          UK's methane emissions.
